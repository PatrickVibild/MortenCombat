This README will go through the error screen and how to make your own questions.

The error screen will open if the "questionsanswers.txt" file can't be found in this folder.
Make sure the file is there, is spelled correctly and it is a .txt file.

If the file is there and it is in the correct format:

Then make sure there are atleast one full question in the file.
There needs to be atleast 5 lines of text to make a valid question.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make your own question list, make a backup of the old questions if you wish to keep them.
Then create a new file with the name "questionsanswers.txt".
In that file write the first line as your question the second line as the correct answer,
line three, four and five should be wrong but plausible answers.
Repeat this format as many times as you want, with a new question every 5 lines.

It should look like this:

1. question
2. correct
3. wrong
4. wrong
5. wrong
1. question
2. correct
3. wrong
4. wrong
5. wrong
1. question
2. correct
3. wrong
4. wrong
5. wrong
